In Class team Exercise – Business Rules and ER Diagrams

Use the following descriptions of the operations of RC\_ Models Company to complete this exercise. RC\_ Models Company sells its products— plastic models (aircraft, ships, and cars) and “add- on” decals for those models— through its Internet Web site, www. Rc\_models. com. Models and decals are available in scales that vary from 1/ 144 to 1/ 32\.

Customers use the Web site to select the products and to pay by credit card. If a product is not currently available, it is placed on back order at the customer’s discretion. (Back orders are not charged to a customer until the order is shipped.) When a customer completes a transaction, the invoice is printed and the products listed on the invoice are pulled from inventory for shipment. (The invoice includes a shipping charge.) The printed invoice is enclosed in the shipping container. The customer credit card charges are transmitted to the CC Bank, at which RC\_ Models Company maintains a commercial account. (Note: The CC Bank is not part of the RC\_ Models database.)

RC\_ Models Company tracks customer purchases and periodically sends out promotional materials. Because the management at RC\_ Models Company requires detailed information to conduct its operations, numerous reports are available. Those reports include, but are not limited to, customer purchases by product category and amount, product turnover, and revenues by product and customer. If a product has not recorded a sale within four weeks of being stocked, it is removed from inventory and scrapped.

Many of the customers on the RC\_ Models customer list have bought RC\_ Models products. However, RC\_ Models Company also has purchased a copy of the FineScale Modeler magazine subscription list to use in marketing its products to customers who have not yet bought from RC\_ Models Company. In addition, customer data are recorded when potential customers request product information.

RC\_ Models Company orders its products directly from the manufacturers. For example, the plastic models are ordered from Tamiya, Academy, Revell/ Monogram, and others. Decals are ordered from Aeromaster, Tauro, WaterMark, and others. ( Note: Not all manufacturers in the RC\_ Models Company database have received orders.) All orders are placed via the manufacturers’ Web sites, and the order amounts are automatically handled through RC\_ Models’ commercial bank account with the CC Bank. Orders are automatically placed when product inventory reaches the specified minimum quantity on hand. (The number of product units ordered depends on the minimum order quantity specified for each product.)
